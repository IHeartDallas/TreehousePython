# This is a random number game.  It illustrates the following Python skills:
# For loop to determine number of attemps at guessing correct number
# Try/Except if the user enters something other than a number
# if and elif statements to determine if the user entered a number within the given range
# .capitalization() to capitalize the initial letter of the user's name
# prompt the user for information via input()
# parse the user's string input to an int
# import the random moldule
# use random.randint to generate a random number
# dealt with apostrophe on line 10
# used /n to create a new line
# illustrate the use of comments throughout!
